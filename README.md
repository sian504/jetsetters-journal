# The Jetsetter Journal

The Jetsetter Journal is a website for frequent travellers to search for inspiration for their upcoming holidys. Users are also able to share and manage their own recommendations via their profile page.

The functions to build this application were written in Python and using the Flask framework. All data was stored in a Mongodb non-relational database and was deployed via Heroku. 

The [live website is here](https://the-jetsetters-journal-834f32dcb176.herokuapp.com/).

## Database Structure

All data was stored in a Mongodb non-relational database. The database itself was made up of 3 collections: 

- Users
- Locations 
- Recommendations 

Each user was structured in a document consisting of the following information:

![Example of a document in Users collection](static/images/users.png)

Users signed up with a username and a password which was hashed by Werkzeug before being stored in Mongodb. All recommendations added to the platform were assigned with the corresponding username who created them. 


Each location available to view and add recommendations to was structured like so: 

![Example of a document in Locations collection](static/images/location.png)

The location information was dynamically rendered to the view_recommendations page depending on which location was clicked on the interactive map. 


Each recommendation added to the application was structured in the following way: 

![Example of a document in Recommendations collection](static/images/recommendations.png)

All recommendations were assigned a city_id which corresponds to the object_id of the location that each recommendation was for. For example, a recommendation for Bangkok contained the object_Id for the location of Bangkok. This was stored under the field city_id. This was useful when adding recommendations or searching for specific recommendations under a specific city name. 

Recommendations were grouped into 3 categories: 

- Things to do
- Where to eat
- Where to stay

All recommendations had an objectID that enabled specific recommendations to be queried and rendered to the application interface. This made it possible for editing and deletion of recommendations on the site.
