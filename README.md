## Database Structure

All data is stored in a Mongodb non-relational database. The database itself is made up of 3 collections: 

- Users
- Locations 
- Recommendations 

Each user is structured in a document consisting of the following information:

![Example of a document in Users collection](static/images/users.png)

Users sign up with a username and a password which is hashed by Werkzeug before being stored in Mongodb. All recommendations added to the platform are assigned with the corresponding username that added that particular recommendation. 


Each available location on the site is structured like so: 

![Example of a document in Locations collection](static/images/location.png)

The location information is dynamically rendered to the view_recommendations page depending on the location selected on the interactive map. 


Each recommendation added to the application is structured in the following way: 

![Example of a document in Recommendations collection](static/images/recommendations.png)

Each recommendation is linked to a city_id, corresponding to the object_id of the location it pertains to. For instance, a recommendation for Bangkok includes the object_id associated with the Bangkok location, stored in the city_id field. This linkage proves beneficial when adding recommendations or searching for specific recommendations within a particular city.

Recommendations are grouped into 3 categories: 

- Things to do
- Where to eat
- Where to stay

Each recommendation is assigned a unique object_id, allowing for targeted queries and rendering of specific recommendations within the application interface. This unique identifier facilitates the editing and deletion of recommendations on the site.

## Surface

The application is presented with a background hero image throughout. I am using one of my own images as it's suitable for the site's purpose. The nav bar is a solid teal colour and the nav items are white to contrast the navbar. 

The majority of the headings and text are white to contrast the blue hero background image. The only exception to this is the recommendations which are in black as they are displayed on a solid white background to ensure readability. 

The Google font Poppins is used for all the text on the site. This font gives the application a simple but professional feel to it.
